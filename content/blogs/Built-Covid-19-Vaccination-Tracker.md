## Background

At first i really didn't know what i wanted to build, but in the back of my head i wanted to build something that help the community during this hard times with COVID-19 pandemic. Last year i wanted to build a covid-19 Tracker using `react.js` but i always failed to do so because i was getting started learning the framework, so this has been bugging me to build some web app that is going to help us all and i told my self that with this **DO challenge** it was my opportunity to pick it up no matter what framework i will use to build it. So i came up with an idea to build a **COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker** in Canada since i live in **Edmonton, Alberta**. I am planning to expend to a world wide COVID-19 vaccination tracker soon.

### How I built it

This challenge has taught so many lessons than i thought, I was thinking it was going to be a piece of cake to build some simple app but unfortunately deployment can be tricky and thanks to couple **DO** Tutorial i managed to deploy my **COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker**. Originally i started building this web app with a simple react app and scrapping vaccination data from an external `api` up to this point everything was going great i was running my app on my local and i had my data being displayed in my app, so when i deployed my app old friend cors got triggered why one because the `api` source server did not allow old friend `cors` from a non origin url which is when i was deployed the origin request was not coming from local anymore and the `api` i am relying on does not support that, i was really frustrated at that moment but did not give up after doing some research i found well this can't be complicated and i found `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/` which is a url you append to a url with a cors issue and it solves that but this seemed to be to good to be true it wasn't not after couple hours then `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/` server went down so did my data and at this point like "wow " i came in thinking that it was gonna be easy and it kept on getting complicated not until i came across `next.js` when i was reading in their docs it said i could do some serverside logic and "boomâœ¨ðŸš€" all excited again next came as a life saver because instead of making the fetch on the front-end, it has the back-end do it, which passes the results as props to the front-end component and after implementing this it all was easy as `Deploying to DO`.
Picked new skills yes indeed i had never used next.js and i had to learn it as i was building this app.
