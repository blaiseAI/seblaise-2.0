## Vision

This project addresses the need for more understanding and evaluation of critical information infrastructure in African countries. This can lead to vulnerabilities in these systems and networks, resulting in negative impacts on African digital society, such as loss of access to essential services, economic disruption, and security breaches. The project aims to address this problem by providing a framework for identifying and assessing critical information infrastructure in African countries to ensure they are secure and resilient.
