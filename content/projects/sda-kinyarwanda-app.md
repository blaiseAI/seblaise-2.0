## Vision

The SDA Kinyarwanda Hymnal App serves to provide an easily accessible and comprehensive collection of hymns for worship and personal devotion. Recognizing that hymnals are a vital part of religious ceremonies, and understanding the challenges of physical hymnbooks such as portability and accessibility, this mobile application was created to address these needs. It not only presents hymns in a convenient digital format but also allows users to search, categorize, and even learn about the history of each hymn. Furthermore, it fosters a sense of community by enabling hymn sharing via social media or email and incorporating a feedback system to continuously improve the app.
